# BubblesAndPointers

* Overview of the program: This program is supposed to take a number array that is in a mixed order, and then uses a bubble sort to sort the array.
	* How does a bubble sort work?
		A bubble sort works by taking the size of the array, finding the number the size of the ray, and move that from it's position to the very last position. Then after the number the size of the array is moved to the end, it finds the next biggest number and moves it to it's position, which is one less than the last number. It does this until it reaches 0.
* List of functions:
	* **main()**
		* This Function is supposed to run the entire program, and run the sort method.
	* ** printValues(int\*) **
		* This function
